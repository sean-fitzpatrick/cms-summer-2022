    "# Math 2565 Assignment 1: Partial Fractions\n",
    "## University of Lethbridge\n",
    "### January 19, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of partial fraction decomposition is a useful tool for evaluating integrals of rational functions, and it comes up in other contexts as well, such as the method of Laplace transforms for differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem (which one quickly discovers) is that determining the coefficients for a partial fraction decomposition can be an exercise that is both tedious and error-prone. The brute force method (equating coefficients and solving a system of equations) is not particularly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that partial fractions are going to be a part of your life, then you'd like to be able to handle them quickly and accurately. You have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let the computer do it for you\n",
    "2. Develop systematic methods (formulas, even!) to get the job done\n",
    "\n",
    "On this assignment you'll explore both options, using the Sympy Python library."

    "### 4. What about irreducible quadratics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formulas only work for linear terms. What if you have an irreducible quadratic? Well, these are only irreducible if you insist on working over the real numbers. Over the **complex** numbers, they factor just fine! The formulas from Question 3 still work, if you allow $a$ to be a complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we don't want complex numbers in our answer, but the good news is that complex roots to real polynomials occur in *conjugate pairs* (like $x=\\pm 2i$ for $x^2+4$, or $x=2\\pm i$ for $x^2-4x+5$.\n",

    "\n",
    "c) Use the `apart()` command to verify your work. Note that `apart(f,extention=sy.I)` will allow you to perform a partial fraction decomposition with complex factors.\n",

You can replace `subs` by `limit`, or define $g(x)$ as $\\dfrac{2x+1}{(x-1)(x+2i)}$ (i.e. cancel the $x-2i$ factors before evaluating).\n",

          This was not 100% SBG. <q>In-class exercises</q> were 30% of the grade.

          I kept tests, and online homework.

      <title>Strictly cumulative grading</title>

      <slide>
        <title>My introduction</title>

        <p>
          In Fall 2018, our Teaching Centre sent a group (including me!)
          to the MRU iSoTL Symposium in Banff.
        </p>

        <subslide>
          <p>
            One of the talks was by Katrin Becker (MRU) on <q>strictly cumulative grading</q>.
          </p>
        </subslide>

        <subslide>
          <p>
            This is a system where:
            <ul pause="yes">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Students start the year at zero
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Everything earns points
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  All that matters is the total, not where the points come from
                </p>

        <title>My implementation</title>
        <p>
          I decided to try this for <url href="https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/syllabus/Spring2019/Math2090/index.html" visual="">Math 2090</url>,
          a course intended primarily for future elementary school teachers.
        </p>

        <p>
          First time was a very last-minute assignment.
          I appreciated the flexibility this system allowed me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Course included:
          <ul>
            <li>Quizzes</li>
            <li>Assignments</li>
            <li>Presentations</li>

        <title>A small class, at last</title>
        <p>
          Last fall, I brought <q>grading for growth</q> to <url href="https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/syllabus/Fall2021/Math2575/" visual="">Math 2575</url>.
          There were fewer than 10 students in the class!
        </p>

        <subslide>
          <p>
            Students were asked for input on course design. They wanted:
